          <p>In my <a href="https://cjohnson.io/civics/america-in-2020">State of America 2020</a> post, we went over the many layers of existential crisis America is currently facing. The most pressing one is the economic issue. I wrote:</p>
          <p><em>The next big area of concern is the economy. I actually studied economics in college, and I&#39;ll be the first to tell you that most of it is over-wrought academic mumbo-jumbo. What ultimately matters is that the job-money-rent-food cycle continues &quot;working&quot; for most* citizens. Very serious threats like hyperinflation / devaluation of currency, or mass defaults of households and businesses are now on the horizon. When James Carville said &quot;it&#39;s the economy, stupid&quot;, he was referring to this; if most* people cannot sustain their livelihoods through the economic system, and order cannot be kept through the judicial / military system, that&#39;s when the zombie apocalypse starts. Nobody wants the zombie apocalypse to start.</em></p>
          <p>Well, it&#39;s been about a full month. I am unhappy to report that the zombie apocalypse unfortunately seems closer than ever. Alex Jones is probably wondering what seasoning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfZcKCIcug8">goes best on his neighbors</a>.</p>
